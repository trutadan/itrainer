# iTrainer 🏋️
<h2>iTrainer is an AI-powered app that helps you perform exercises correctly.</h2>
<h2>It was developed during the 3 days of the Cluj Hackathon, by Truta Dan (https://github.com/trutadan) and myself.</h2>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<h3>🍏 Exercise is a must for one's health, but to get all the benefits it must be performed correctly.</h3>
<h3>✔️ That is where our solution, iTrainer helps you exercise, giving you real-time advice on your execution. It was developed using an already trained model (PoseNet) and calculating different angles using detected joints(knee, hip, ankle).</h3>
<h3>👨‍💻 We could only implement the Squat in the given 3 days, but the goal of the app is to cover a wider range of exercises</h3>

<h1>Squat Demo</h1>
 <h2>📝 Here we can see two squat executions, one correct and one wrong. iTrainer gives us tips based on the mistakes we've made: </h2>

<h2>✔️ Correct squat: </h2>

<h1>Future development</h1>
<h3>🚀 As seen in the GUI, we are planning to implement exercise recommendations along with more supported exercises.</h3>
